I will start my recipe recording with my dinner plan today, 07/21/19.
I try to organize and display this recipe in less conventional and more practical (IMO) ways,
but this is still not ideal.

My idea of an ideal recipe should be mechanical enough that one can easily turn it into a kitchen agenda,
yet organized enough that one can easily coordinate with other recipes for a more complete meal.
It should be some sort of balance between listing steps in chronological order
and "object oriented" grouping preparation steps by outcome units.
And it definitely should not include a whole diary of emotional connections, not always at least.


# Sausage mushroom pasta and pear salad, 1 serving.

## Ingredients

### Carbs
- Fresh egg pasta

### Veggies
- Mushrooms: ~1/3 pint, or a heaping handful.
> Or, obviously, as much as you like.
I am using oyster mushrooms,
though I intended to use lion's mane mushrooms,
which interested me last time at the farmer's market but was unavailable this time.

- Salad greens: 1 person serving.
> Quantity of salad ingredients is really usually variable, dependent on one's preferred diet and nutrients consumed that day.

- Grape tomatoes: 4 to 6.
> Or cherry tomatoes, in which case double the amount.

- Pear: 1.
> Half is probably enough, but what are you going to do with the other half? Just eat it.

### Proteins
- Sausage: 1
> Using Polish sausages from the market.

### Herbs and spices
- Thyme: 1/4 bunch.

- Basil: 1 sprig.
> Using purple basil.
> The aroma of basil is strong and may over-power thyme, so use conservatively.

- Garlic: 3 cloves.

- Shallot: 1 head.

## Steps
```
Wet prep:
Tri-wash salad greens.
Rinse tomatoes, thyme, basil, pear, mushrooms.
```

```
Dry prep:
Chop salad greens into bite size pieces.
I've found this to allow more even distribution of dressing,
as well as reduce the raw-vegetable-ness that I who grew up eating cooked vegetables never came to fully relish.

Half tomatoes.

Chop pear into cubes of 1 to 1.5 cm.

Cut mushrooms into bite size, ensuring that stems are all cut, to promote better absorption of juices.

Slice garlic and shallots.

Finely chop thyme, except for 4 to 6 sprigs.

Finely chop basil.

Score sausage with 3 or 4 slits, and lay the thyme sprigs on top.

```

```
Oven:
Preheat at 400 F.

Line baking dish with parchment paper/foil.
  Use two dishes to avoid mixing flavors of ingredients for pasta and for salad,
  but if only one is available, as would be the case in a short term housing,
  create a wall with the parchment paper to partition the dish space into 1/3 and 2/3.

Place the sausage (with thyme sprigs) and the tomatoes in the 2/3 part,
and the pear cubes into the 1/3.

Spray or sprinkle with olive oil on all.

Bake for 15 mins or until sausage is cooked.
```

```
Pasta base:
Heat olive oil in a (lidded) pan with medium heat.
Add, in order, and not adding next until you smell aroma of the current: shallots, thyme, garlic.
Then add mushrooms and 1 cup of water, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Finally, add in fresh pasta, spread out in pan, cover with lid and let it cook for 1 minute.
```

```
Rinse(item):
  place item under running water
```

```
Tri_wash(item):
  repeat 3 times:
    fill bowl with clean water
    place item in bowl
    lightly rub, stir item in water
    pour water out, leaving item in bowl
```
