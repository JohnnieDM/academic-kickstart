I will start my recipe recording with my dinner plan today, 07/21/19.

# Sausage mushroom pasta, 1 serving.

## Ingredients
- Mushrooms: ~1/2 pint
> Or, obviously, as much as liked.
I am using oyster mushrooms,
though I intended to use lion's mane mushrooms,
which interested me last time at the farmer's market but was unavailable this time.

- Sausage: 1
> I am using Polish sausages from the market.

- Thyme: 1/4 bunch

- Basil: 1 sprig.
> Using purple basil.
> The aroma of basil is strong and may over-power thyme, so use conservatively.

## Steps
```python
def abc():
  if True:
    return 1.2 + 1
  else:
    return str
```
