I will start my recipe recording with my dinner plan today, 07/21/19.

# Sausage mushroom pasta, 1 serving.

## Ingredients
- Mushrooms: ~1/2 pint
> Or, obviously, as much as liked.
I am using oyster mushrooms,
though I intended to use lion's mane mushrooms,
which interested me last time at the farmer's market but was unavailable this time.

- Sausage: 1
> I am using Polish sausages from the farmer's market.
