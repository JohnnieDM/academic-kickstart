I will start my recipe recording with my dinner plan today, 07/21/19.

# Sausage mushroom pasta and pear salad, 1 serving.

## Ingredients

### Carbs
- Fresh egg pasta

### Veggies
- Mushrooms: ~1/2 pint
> Or, obviously, as much as liked.
I am using oyster mushrooms,
though I intended to use lion's mane mushrooms,
which interested me last time at the farmer's market but was unavailable this time.

- Salad greens: 1 person serving.
> Quantity of salad ingredients is really usually variable, dependent on one's preferred diet and nutrients consumed that day.

- Grape tomatoes: 4 to 6.
> Or cherry tomatoes, in which case double the amount.

- Pear: 1.
> Half is probably enough, but what are you going to do with the other half? Just eat it.

### Proteins
- Sausage: 1
> Using Polish sausages from the market.

### Herbs and spices
- Thyme: 1/4 bunch.

- Basil: 1 sprig.
> Using purple basil.
> The aroma of basil is strong and may over-power thyme, so use conservatively.

- Garlic: 3 cloves.

- Shallot: 1 head.

## Steps
```
Wet prep:
Tri-wash salad greens.
Rinse tomatoes, thyme, pear, mushrooms.
```

```
Dry prep:
Chop salad greens into bite size pieces.
I've found this to allow more even distribution of dressing,
as well as reduce the raw-vegetable-ness that I who grew up eating cooked vegetables never came to fully relish.

Half tomatoes.

Chop pear into cubes of 1 to 1.5 cm.

Cut mushrooms into bite size, ensuring that stems are all cut, to promote better absorption of juices.

Slice garlic and shallots.

Finely chop thyme, except for 4 to 6 sprigs.

Score sausage with 3 or 4 slits, and lay the thyme sprigs on top.

```

```
Oven:

Line baking dish with parchment paper/foil.
  Use two dishes to avoid mixing flavors of ingredients for pasta and for salad,
  but if only one is available, as would be the case in a short term housing,
  create a wall with the parchment paper to partition the dish space into 1/3 and 2/3.

Place the sausage (with thyme sprigs) and the tomatoes in the 2/3 part,
and the pear cubes into the 1/3.
```

```
Pasta base:
Heat olive oil in a pan.

```

```python
def Rinse(item):
  place item under running water
  
```

```
Tri_wash(item):
  repeat 3 times:
    fill bowl with clean water
    place item in bowl
    lightly rub, stir item in water
    pour water out, leaving item in bowl
```
