abstract = "Many real-world systems generate a tremendous amount of
data cataloging the actions, responses, and internal states.
Prominent examples include user logs on web servers, instrumentation
of source code, and performance statistics in large
data centers. The magnitude of this data makes it impossible
to log individual events, but instead requires capturing
aggregate statistics at a coarser granularity, resulting in statistical
distributions instead of discrete values. We survey
several popular statistical distance measures and demonstrate
how appropriate statistical distances can allow meaningful
clustering of web log data."
